# Project: Generating Random Quiz Files
# 1. Creates 35 different quizzes
# 2. Creates 50 multiple-choice questions for each quiz, in random order
# 3. Provides the correct answer and three random wrong answers for
#     each question, in random order
# 4. Writes the quizzes to 35 text files
# 5. Writes the answer keys to 35 text files

# The code will need to do the following:
# 1. Store the states and their capitals in a dictionary
# 2. Call open(), write(), and close() for the Q&A key text files
# 3. Use random.shuffle() to randomize order
